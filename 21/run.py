# this problem was kind of poorly written. it was the same as the
# ticket-numbering problem, but the wording was pretty off this time. it didn't
# seem like there was a one-to-one correspondence between allergens and
# ingredients. the wording made it sound like nskl and xbxcvz could both contain
# milk. part 2 was somewhat trivial, really, but after yesterday's monster
# hunting, I'm not complaining.
